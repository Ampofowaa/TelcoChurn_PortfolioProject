"""FastAPI serving app — the process uvicorn runs (`telco_churn.serving.app:app`).

**Versioning decision, recorded rather than left implicit: routes ship
unversioned this phase (`/predict`, not `/predict/v1`).** There is no
external consumer yet — this phase's own tests, Phase 10's `/ready` poll, and
Phase 11's CI all live in this repo and can move in lockstep with a route
rename. Adopt an `/v1` prefix no later than Phase 11, before either of those
consumers exists to break.

**Config is resolved once, in `lifespan`, and stashed on `app.state` — not at
import time.** `compose_config()`/`activate_config()` need Hydra's config
directory and (for the champion load) a reachable MLflow; running them at
module import would make importing this module for a test fail before a test
even gets to choose what to mock. Every request handler reads `request.app.state.cfg`
instead of a module-level global.

**`serving/predict.py` (Task 3) already owns hot-reload, shadow/canary
routing, and five of the module's Prometheus metrics; `serving/customer_lookup.py`
owns Postgres ID-resolution — this module is a thin HTTP skin over both, not
a second implementation of either.** `GET /metrics` needs no extra wiring for
any of it: `prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator`'s `Instrumentator().expose(app)`
serves the entire default `prometheus_client` registry, which already
contains every metric `predict.py` registered at import time, plus this
module's own `prediction_log_write_failures_total` — owned here rather than
`serving/prediction_log.py` because this module is what swallows the write
failure that increments it (see `_log_prediction_background` below).

    """Startup: load config, start the initial-load-then-poll background
    task, and return (`yield`) immediately. Shutdown: flip readiness first,
    then drain.

    **The initial champion load must never be awaited directly in this
    function's own body.** uvicorn's own `Server.startup()` awaits the ASGI
    lifespan's startup phase (this function, up to its `yield`) *before* it
    ever calls `loop.create_server(...)` — the listening socket isn't even
    opened yet, let alone accepting connections, until this coroutine
    reaches `yield`. `load_serving_state_with_retry` retries forever on a
    genuine cold start with no `champion` alias to resolve, so awaiting it
    here would mean the socket never opens at all: not just `/ready`, but
    `/health` too — the liveness probe this project's own design explicitly
    says "must never restart-loop a process that was never actually broken"
    (see `health()`'s docstring below) — would be unreachable for as long as
    MLflow has nothing to serve. Folding the initial load into the same
    background task the periodic hot-reload poll already runs on fixes
    this: `yield` happens right after the task is spawned, uvicorn opens the
    socket immediately, and `/health`/`/ready` (503, via `get_runtime`'s and
    `ready()`'s own `app.state.runtime is None`/`app.state.ready` checks)
    are reachable the whole time the task is still retrying underneath.

    The SIGTERM handler is registered separately from (and ahead of) the
    normal shutdown path below, because App Runner's scale-to-zero sends
    SIGTERM routinely, not just on deploys — by the time Starlette's own
    shutdown event fires, uvicorn has typically already stopped accepting
    new connections, which is too late for '/ready' to have warned the
    platform to stop routing here in the first place. Falls back to a no-op
    where add_signal_handler isn't available — Windows dev boxes (the
    container runtime this matters for is Linux, which supports it), and
    any test harness that runs this lifespan off the main thread (Starlette's
    TestClient does, via a background anyio portal); real uvicorn always
    runs lifespan on the main thread, so production is unaffected.
