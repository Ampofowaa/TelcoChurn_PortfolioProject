"""Loads the champion model from MLflow at process startup, keeps it fresh via
a hot-reload poll, and scores requests — including the shadow/canary
mechanism and SHAP explanation.

**Hot-reload over redeploy.** A promotion is just an MLflow alias flip;
nothing about it requires restarting this process. `resolve_serving_model`
polls on a short TTL for whether `champion`/`challenger` have moved and, on a
change, diffs the new version's MLflow-logged dependencies against what's
actually installed (`environment_parity.py::diff_environment`) before
swapping it in. Compatible -> hot-reload in place. Diverged -> refuse, log
loudly, keep serving the old version. `load_serving_state_with_retry` is the
one exception: the *initial* load (no model in memory yet) retries with
backoff on any failure rather than degrading, since there is no
"last-known-good" to fall back to yet — fail-open on refresh, fail-closed on
initial load.

**Shadow vs. canary — two independent, config-gated toggles, not one flag
with two readings.** Shadow scores every request against the challenger for
comparison but never serves its opinion. Canary actually routes a
consistent-hash slice of traffic (by `customerid`) to the challenger. A
request with no `customerid` (a prospect scored in manual/what-if mode) is
never canary-routed — no customerid means no stable bucket, so it always
gets the default variant (champion), the same "no targeting key -> default
variant" rule feature-flag platforms (LaunchDarkly, OpenFeature) use.
`score_request` is the one place this routing happens, and it is fully
vectorized (never a per-row Python loop) so `predict_batch` can call it once
on an assembled DataFrame the same way `predict_single` calls it on a 1-row
frame.

**The SHAP explainer and the threshold policy both reload in lockstep with
the model, inside the same `build_model_bundle` call that swaps a champion
in — never cached for the process's lifetime.** A `TreeExplainer` genuinely
cached across a promotion would keep explaining the old booster after the
probability next to it already reflects the new model; a threshold cached
across a promotion would judge a new model's score against a `t*` derived
for a different version. `ModelBundle` bundles model + preprocessor +
booster + explainer + threshold policy as one atomic, swap-in-one-piece unit
for exactly this reason.

**Feature assembly is serving's own job, not features/build.py's.**
`build_feature_df` (features/build.py) assumes `charge_per_service` has
already been computed by the `sql/features/charge_per_service.sql` view —
true during training (Postgres computes it before Python ever sees the row),
false here (a prospect or what-if request was never in Postgres to begin
with). `_assemble_model_input` instead calls
`features/generate.py::compute_charge_per_service` — the existing,
already-tested pandas mirror of that SQL view, built for exactly this
"no database connection" case — directly on the request's raw fields.
