## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-08 — Phase 4: Feature Engineering (SQL + Python)

*Builds features in two layers: SQL views in Postgres and four hypothesis-driven Python columns.
Returns a raw, untransformed feature DataFrame — ColumnTransformer fitting and train/val/test
split are Phase 5 responsibilities.*

### Added
- **SQL feature views** (`sql/features/`) — `tenure_buckets.sql` (four tenure cohorts),
  `charge_per_service.sql` (monthly charges ÷ active service count), and `customer_features.sql`
  (join view read by the Python feature builder). Built idempotently via `build_sql_features(engine)`.
- **Python feature engineering** (`src/telco_churn/features/build.py`) — `build_feature_df(df)`
  adds four columns: `is_long_month_to_month` (H1), `monthly_to_total_ratio` (H2),
  `fiber_contract` and `dsl_contract` (H3a/b — contract × internet-service interactions).
  Returns the raw augmented DataFrame; y extraction is Phase 5's responsibility. NaN preserved
  for 11 zero-tenure rows for Phase 5 imputation.
- **Column group exports** — `BINARY_COLS`, `MULTI_CAT_COLS`, `NUMERIC_COLS`, `PYTHON_ENGINEERED_COLS`
  exported from `build.py` and surfaced via `features/__init__.py` as the public API for Phase 5.
- **SQL feature runner** (`src/telco_churn/features/sql_features.py`) — executes the three SQL
  files in dependency order via SQLAlchemy; idempotent (`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`).
- **Feature engineering notebook** (`notebooks/02-feature-engineering.ipynb`) — thin wrapper
  rendering SQL feature distributions and Python feature validation outputs.
- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/test_build.py`) — 37 tests covering H1, H2, H3a, H3b correctness,
  NaN propagation, column count invariant, target/ID exclusion, and no input mutation. Includes
  `hypothesis` property-based tests.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/test_sql_features_postgres.py`) — verifies SQL views
  are created correctly against a live Postgres instance; skips when Docker is not running.

### Changed
- `ANALYSIS.md §3` rewritten with Phase 4 results: SQL feature evidence tables, Python feature
  hypothesis → evidence → result for H1–H3, and the 25-column feature inventory.
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` Phase 4 spec cleaned up; Phase 5 updated to own `ColumnTransformer`
  definition and fitting; `FeatureSchema` frozen dataclass added to Phase 5 deliverables.
- `CLAUDE.md` Testing section — two rules added: `__main__` CLI entry points require an
  integration test covering the full pipeline path; each new package requires a scoped
  `make test-<package>` Makefile target.

### Fixed
- `make test-features` added to `Makefile` — scoped to `--cov=src/telco_churn/features`; Phase 4
  tests run in isolation without a false `fail_under=80` failure from uncovered Phase 2 modules.
- `_PYTHON_ENGINEERED` renamed to `PYTHON_ENGINEERED_COLS` in `features/build.py`, exported from
  `features/__init__.py`, and import in integration test updated to the public path.
- `CustomerFeaturesSchema.monthlycharges` now declares `lt=np.inf`; `FeatureOutputSchema.monthly_to_total_ratio`
  drops `lt=np.inf` — `inf` is now unreachable by construction rather than caught on output.
- `customer_features.sql` LEFT JOIN intent undocumented; comment added noting `customers_raw` is
  the authoritative row source and Pandera `nullable=False` is the downstream guard.
- `_make_feature_row` fixture hardcoded `charge_per_service` as `/ 2`; corrected to derive from
  service flags via the SQL formula (correct for default configuration is `/ 3`).
- `test_build_feature_df_invalid_tenure_cohort_raises` added — invalid `tenure_cohort` category
  was not covered by existing input schema guard tests.
- Hypothesis `max_examples` raised from 40 → 100 on both property tests.
- `build_feature_df` docstring corrected from "H1–H3" to "H1, H2, H3a, and H3b".
- `exclude_lines` was under `[tool.coverage.run]` instead of `[tool.coverage.report]`; coverage.py
  silently ignored it. Moved to the correct section — suite coverage corrected from 86.61% to 97.64%.
- H1 boundary (`tenure > 24`) had no fencepost tests at `tenure=24` or `tenure=25`; two tests added.
- Four queries in `test_sql_features_postgres.py` used f-string interpolation into raw SQL;
  replaced with SQLAlchemy bound parameters.
- `build_feature_df` previously raised an opaque `KeyError` when SQL view columns were missing;
  now raises a named `SchemaError` via `CustomerFeaturesSchema` input validation.
- `SELECT *` in `build.py __main__` replaced with an explicit column list from
  `BINARY_COLS + MULTI_CAT_COLS + NUMERIC_COLS`.
- `customerid` was excluded from `telco_churn_processed.csv`; now written as the first column.
- `make test-integration` was a silent no-op — ran without `--run-integration` so all integration
  tests were skipped. Flag added to the target.
- `make features` target was missing from the `Makefile`; added to complete the
  `ingest → validate → features → train` chain.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-06 — Phase 3: EDA Notebook

*Promotes all EDA logic from the original research notebook into a testable, importable `src/`
module. The EDA notebook becomes a thin rendering wrapper; statistical helpers become reusable
production code.*

### Added
- **EDA helper library** (`src/telco_churn/data/eda.py`) — seven public functions: IQR outlier
  detection, per-group churn rates, chi-squared + Cramér's V, Mann-Whitney U + rank-biserial r,
  Pearson correlation matrix, top-N target correlations, and VIF. All functions handle edge cases
  (empty DataFrame, NaN, constant columns, perfect collinearity) via `warnings.warn` rather than
  raising.
- **VIF without `statsmodels`** — derived from `sklearn.LinearRegression` R², eliminating a
  50 MB+ dependency.
- **Column constants** — `CAT_FEATURES`, `NUM_FEATURES`, `BINARY_INT_FEATURES`, `TARGET` exported
  as the single source of truth for column lists across EDA, validation, and feature engineering.
- **EDA notebook** (`notebooks/01-eda.ipynb`) — thin wrapper covering class imbalance, univariate
  distributions, bivariate churn-rate analysis, statistical tests with effect sizes, correlation
  heatmap, VIF table, and a contract × internet-service interaction that motivates Phase 4
  engineering. Original archived at `notebooks/_archive/EDA-original.ipynb`.
- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/test_eda.py`) — 50+ tests covering all seven functions under normal
  inputs, missing values, wrong dtype, and empty DataFrame. Warning emission verified with
  `pytest.warns`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-03 — Pre-Phase 3 Cleanup

*Fixes identified in a post-QA audit. No modelling logic changed.*

### Added
- Two missing schema constraint tests added to `tests/unit/test_checks.py`: invalid
  `contract_type` value and unexpected extra column. Test count: 49 → 51; coverage holds at
  80.73 %.

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` corrected: source-of-truth pointers, test file references, and Phase 7 notebook
  name fixed.

### Fixed
- `mirrors-mypy` pre-commit hook bumped from `v1.13.0` → `v2.1.0` to match `mypy>=2.1.0` in
  `pyproject.toml`; eliminates "passes locally, fails in CI" type errors.
- Pre-commit mypy hook now runs `mypy src/` with `pass_filenames: false` — matches CI exactly
  and avoids duplicate-module errors from the two `conftest.py` files.
- `tests/` added to mypy `exclude` list in `pyproject.toml`; type-checking scoped to `src/` only.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-03 — QA & Standards Hardening

*Addresses code quality and documentation gaps identified in a review against industry DS
standards. No modelling logic changed.*

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `ANALYSIS.md` added.
- `src/telco_churn/py.typed` added (PEP 561) so downstream type checkers pick up inline types.
- `fail_under = 80` added to `pyproject.toml` — failing coverage is caught locally before CI.
- Minimal GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint, type-check, and unit
  tests with coverage on every push and PR.

### Changed
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` restored and rewritten — Phases 3, 4, and the body of Phase 5 were missing
  due to file corruption; all 15 phases now present. Phase status table added.
- README rewritten as a project landing page; modelling rationale moved to `ANALYSIS.md`.
- Validation thresholds (min row count, max null rate) moved from source code to
  `configs/config.yaml`.
- Data source path now configurable via `--csv-path` CLI flag.

### Fixed
- Integration tests now skip automatically when Docker is not running rather than failing with a
  connection error. Pass `--run-integration` to run them explicitly.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-01 — Phase 2: Data Validation

*Establishes automated data quality checks that run before any modelling begins.*

### Added
- **Five validation gates** with two severity levels — ERROR (blocking) and WARNING (non-blocking,
  logged). All five pass on the IBM Telco dataset:
  - Gate 1 — Schema (ERROR): Pandera validates column presence, types, ranges, and allowed
    categorical values.
  - Gate 2 — Duplicate IDs (ERROR): asserts `customerid` is unique.
  - Gate 3 — Churn labels (ERROR): asserts `churn` is binary with no nulls.
  - Gate 4 — Unexpected TotalCharges nulls (WARNING): flags nulls only where `tenure > 0`; the
    11 zero-tenure nulls are expected and ignored.
  - Gate 5 — Distribution sanity (WARNING): row count below 1,000 or null rate above 5 % on
    key columns.
- **Schema inheritance** (`RawSchema` → `CleanedSchema`) — `CleanedSchema` additionally requires
  `totalcharges` to be non-null, verifying imputation ran before downstream stages.
- **`clean_dataframe()`** — median imputation for the 11 known NULL `totalcharges` rows;
  preserves all 7,043 customers.
- **Validation reports** written to `reports/validation/<timestamp>/` on failure — `summary.csv`
  per gate and `<gate>_failures.csv` for offending rows.

### Fixed
- Analysis notebooks now render correctly on GitHub. Notebook format upgraded and cell identifiers
  standardised; pre-commit hook added to prevent regression.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31 — Phase 1: Data Ingestion

*Moves the raw CSV into Postgres, establishing the foundation for all downstream SQL-based
feature engineering.*

### Added
- **Raw data ingestion** (`src/telco_churn/data/ingest.py`) — loads CSV into `customers_raw`
  table. Retains all 7,043 rows including the 11 zero-tenure customers with null `TotalCharges`.
- **Idempotent ingestion** (`if_exists="replace"`) — re-running never creates duplicates.
- **SQL schema** (`sql/schema/001_create_raw.sql`) — explicit column types; `customerid` as
  primary key. Applied automatically on container first start.
- **Column name normalisation** — names lowercased and SQL reserved words renamed at ingest time
  (`partner` → `has_partner`, `contract` → `contract_type`).
- **Structured logging** — records row counts and table names on every run.
- **Postgres in Docker** (`docker-compose.yml`, `infra` profile) — reproducible local database
  with a healthcheck.
- **Unit and integration tests** — unit tests cover parsing; integration tests use
  `testcontainers` to verify the full CSV → Postgres path including idempotency.

---

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-28 — Phase 0: Project Foundation

*Establishes the development environment, tooling, and project structure that all subsequent
phases build on.*

### Added
- **Reproducible environment** via `uv` + `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — `ruff`, `black`, `mypy --strict` (src/ only), `detect-secrets`, and
  standard file checks.
- **Configuration-driven design** via Hydra — paths, random seed, MLflow settings, and tunable
  parameters in `configs/config.yaml`.
- **Structured JSON logging** via `structlog` — machine-readable, compatible with CloudWatch
  and Grafana.
- **Project directory skeleton** — `src/`, `tests/`, `configs/`, `sql/`, `pipelines/`, `docs/`,
  `notebooks/`, `datasets/`.
- **`Makefile` shortcuts** — `make lint`, `make test`, `make validate`, `make train`.
- **Architecture diagram** (`docs/architecture.md`) documenting the intended end-to-end system
  design.
